we lost everything
we had to pay the price
yeah we lost everything
we had to pay the price

i saw in you what life was missing
you lit a flame that consumed my hate
I'm not one for reminiscing but
I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace

yeah
cause we lost everything
we had to pay the price

there's a canvas with two faces
of fallen angels who loved and lost
it was a passion for the ages
and in the end guess we paid the cost

a thing of beauty - i know
will never fade away
what you did to me - i know
said what you had to say
but a thing of beauty

will never fade away
will never fade away
will never fade away

i see your eyes, i know you see me
you're like a ghost how you're everywhere
I am your demon never leaving
a metal soul of rage and fear

that one thing that changed it all
that one sin that caused the fall

a thing of beauty - I know
will never fade away
what you did to me - I know
said what you had to say
but a thing of beauty - I know
will never fade away
and I'll do my duty - I know
somehow I'll find a way
but a thing of beauty
will never fade away
and I'll do my duty

yeah
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away
